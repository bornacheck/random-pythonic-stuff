# random-pythonic-stuff
*its self explanatory ;)*

all apps will run on python 3.x.
i recommend trying python 3.10
use pyinstaller or a simillar app to convert anything to an exe.

feel free to modify any part of the program, 
though major changes that dont follow the original 
function of the program will be considered a spin-off and not
related to the original file on the GitHub repository.

*more readme coming soon*
